# Implementation of well known groupping algorithms

### CLARANS
The CLARANS algorithm is a variant of the k-centroid algorithm. The idea of ​​the algorithm is to search the graph G, whose vertices are variously selected k centroids. The vertices are interconnected if the difference in represented elections concerns only one centroid. Each vertex is described by the value of the TC grouping function. The graph search begins with any vertex of the graph. At each step, max_neighbour neighboring vertices are checked. If the value of the grouping function of any neighbor is better than the value of the currently considered node, the algorithm makes the transition and examines the neighborhood of the newly selected vertex again. If, after completing the transition and exploring the max_neighbour neighborhood, a neighbor is not found, the better the algorithm writes the value of the found local minimum, randomly selects a new startpoint and repeats the search process described earlier. The search is repeated num_local number of times. Out of all local minima found, one is selected and returned with the best value of the rating function.
